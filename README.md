# Guide de préparation à la certification AI-900 : Principes de base de l’Intelligence Artificielle sur Azure : AI-900

## Purpose

This document is for Microsoft Certified Trainers preparing to teach AI-900: AI Fundamentals. 
This course is designed for students who are planning to take the corresponding certification exam, 
or students who want to learn about AI capabilities in Azure.

## Course description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) will define the next generation of software solutions and unlocks the potential to create amazing applications. 
This course introduces fundamentals concepts related to artificial intelligence (AI), and the services in Microsoft Azure that can be used to create 
AI solutions. The course is not designed to teach students to become professional data scientists or software developers, but rather to build awareness 
of common AI workloads and the ability to identify Azure services to support them.
This course can be taken as an optional first step in learning about cloud AI services with Microsoft Azure, 
before taking further Azure role-based certifications like Azure Data Scientist Associate or Azure AI Engineer Associate. 
This course is designed to be delivered in one full day.
The course is designed as a blended learning experience that combines instructor-led training with online materials on the Microsoft Learn 
platform (https://docs.microsoft.com/learn). The hands-on exercises in the course are completed in the associated Microsoft Learn modules, 
and students are encouraged to use the content on Learn as reference materials to reinforce what they learn in class and to explore topics in more depth.

## Learning objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to:
- Describe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations
- Describe fundamental principles of machine learning on Azure
- Describe features of computer vision workloads on Azure
- Describe features of Natural Language Processing (NLP) workloads on Azure
- Describe features of generative AI workloads on Azure.

## Audience profile

The Azure AI Fundamentals course is designed for anyone interested in learning about the types of solution artificial intelligence (AI) makes possible, 
and the services on Microsoft Azure that you can use to create them. 
You don’t need to have any experience of using Microsoft Azure before taking this course, but a basic level of familiarity with computer technology
and the Internet is assumed.
Some of the concepts covered in the course require a basic understanding of mathematics, such as the ability to interpret charts. 
The course includes hands-on activities that involve working with data and running code, so a knowledge of fundamental programming principles will be helpful.

## Audience prerequisites

Prerequisite certification is not required before taking this course. Successful Azure AI Fundamental students start with some basic awareness of computing and internet concepts, and an interest in using Azure AI services.
Specifically:
- Experience using computers and the internet.
- Interest in use cases for AI applications and machine learning models.
- A willingness to learn through hands-on exploration.
